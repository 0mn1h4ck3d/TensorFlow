## Projects
### Project 1: [Animals Project](https://github.com/traizooo/TensorFlow/tree/main)
**Description:** The Animals Project is a machine learning model developed using TensorFlow. Its main objective is to recognize and classify different types of animals. The model is trained on a dataset containing various animal images and utilizes deep learning techniques to accurately identify the animals present in new images.

### Project 2: [Matura Project](https://github.com/traizooo/TensorFlow/tree/main)
**Description:** The Matura Project is a machine learning model that analyzes Google Trends searches related to the Polish Matura topic. The goal of this project is to gain insights into the search trends and patterns surrounding the Matura, which is the standardized secondary school examination in Poland. The model uses various machine learning algorithms to process and interpret the search data, allowing for the exploration of trends and correlations.

## Notebooks
### Notebook 1: [Animals Notebook](https://github.com/traizooo/TensorFlow/blob/main/Datasets.ipynb)
**Description:** The Animals Notebook is a Jupyter notebook developed in Google Colab. It provides a detailed analysis and implementation of the Animals Project. The notebook includes step-by-step explanations of the model's architecture, data preprocessing techniques, model training, and evaluation. Additionally, it may contain visualizations of the model's performance and examples of animal recognition.

## Notebook 2: [Matura Notebook](https://github.com/traizooo/TensorFlow/blob/main/Matura.ipynb)
**Description:** The Matura Notebook is a Jupyter notebook developed in Google Colab. It focuses on the implementation and analysis of the Matura Project. The notebook explores the dataset of Google Trends search data related to the Polish Matura and demonstrates the machine learning techniques used to uncover insights and patterns within the data. It may include visualizations, statistical analysis, and interpretations of the search trends.

## Notebook 3: [Helper Functions Notebook](https://github.com/traizooo/TensorFlow/blob/main/helper_functions.py)
**Description:** The Helper Functions Notebook is a collection of reusable functions that can be used in various machine learning projects and notebooks. These functions are designed to assist with common tasks such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and visualization. By using the functions provided in this notebook, developers can save time and effort when working on new projects, as they can easily incorporate these helper functions into their code.
